/*  
Bubble sort is considered the most basic sorting algorithm . It works by starting at the first element of an array and comparing it to the second element:
  • If the first element is greater than the second element, it swaps the two.
  • It then compares the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and so on.
    - In this way, the largest values 'bubble' to the end of the array.
  • Once it gets to the end of the array, it starts over and repeats the process until the array is sorted numerically.

Examples:
findBubbleSort([7,4,1,9,23,16]) // => [1,4,7,9,16,23]
findBubbleSort([4,-2,3,9,16,10]) // => [-2,3,4,9,10,16]
findBubbleSort([1,4,7,18,24,20]) // => ][1,4,7,18,20,24]

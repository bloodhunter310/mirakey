# Project Guide Lines

## High Level Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will be familiar with the following:

- Planing for a project
- Designing the web app

## Before You Start

### Think Of The Idea Thoroughly

One of the important things to do is to think thoroughly about the idea and more precisely about the features that its going to have here are some suggestions to consider when planning.

- Think about the main features and estimate how much you need to implement them
- Think about how to make the idea feel more unique
- Think about how to increase the scale and improve it in the future
- Fill the students sheet's project information and wait for confirmation before you start coding

### Design The Layout In Advance

Designing the layout before you start is an important step because it defines the idea in a clearer way and might let you notice features you have missed or gives idea about what features you need to add.

- Design the basic layout of the website by drawing it digitally or by hand, you could create the wire-frame using this link [link](https://wireframe.cc/)
- Depending on the design think about how you could use CSS `grid` or `flex` to implement it
- Split the design into sections, to select elements more easily, for example `#about h1`,  `#about p`, `#contact input`, `#contact button`
- Think about how you can group similar elements using the same class for reuseable styling

### Prepare The Repository

Create the repository and clone it so you don't forget and to make sure git is working as it should.

## After You Start

- Create the Basic layout with the different sections, without filling out the content
- Start by doing one sections at a time
- Work on the content first (HTML), then the logic (JS) and when done add the styling (CSS)
- Commit the changes frequently after every feature is done (after HTML, JS, CSS changes)
- Push the code every 2 hours, so we can monitor your progress, even if there are not many changes done
- Make sure to document the code using comments
- If you feel stuck ask for help

## When You Finish

- Clean the code, fix indentation, remove unnecessary `console.logs`, convert ES5 code to ES6 (if any found)
- Test the whole project
- Record a 3-5 mins video demoing your project
- The video will be a recording of your screen while showcasing the features and commentating over it
- Upload the video before the deadline
